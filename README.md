# ToyDB Database

ToyDB is a lightweight JSON database designed to simplify data storage and retrieval for small to medium-scale applications. This README.md file provides an overview of ToyDB's features and usage.

## Features

### JSON-Based
ToyDB uses JSON as the primary data format, making it easy to work with structured data. JSON is human-readable, making it straightforward to inspect and manipulate data.

### File System Storage
Data is stored directly on the file system, eliminating the need for a separate database server. This approach simplifies data management and reduces overhead.

### Collections
ToyDB organizes data into collections, allowing you to group related data together. Each collection acts as a container for JSON documents.

### Query Capabilities
You can perform queries on your data using simple and intuitive commands, enabling efficient data retrieval.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
ToyDB offers a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the database. You can easily create, read, update, and delete data using familiar commands.

### Configurable
ToyDB is highly configurable, allowing you to specify the location of your database and customize various settings to meet your application's requirements.
